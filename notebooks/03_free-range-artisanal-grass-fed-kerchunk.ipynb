However, astute readers will note that the data type (`dtype`) defined here is `<f4`, or \"little-endian floating point of four bytes (32-bit)\". This discrepancy is because the TIFF is _intended_ to representing floating point data, but it does so using `uint16` with a scale factor to reduce the file size.\n",

    "## Building our kerchunk config\n",
    "\n",
    "Kerchunk comes in two json versions: 0 and 1. Refer to [the documentation for a longer explanation with examples](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/spec.html#).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: version 0 is rather simple, effectively merging all zarr metadata files together into a single file. Each data array is then also defined in the file with a source path, offset, and length. Version 1 provides some additional features, primarily templating support to facilitate reducing similar, highly repetative definitions into iterative patterns, both to make the file easier to write and to reduce its length. (It turns out that the size of json file can be a bottleneck/problem with large kerchunk datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we could leverage templating within the file, but it is easier both to script the file generation and check that what we produced looks reasonable if we do so in python rather than as a templated kerchunk file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What \"files\" do we need to define?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're effectively building a zarr dataset, without converting our data to native zarr arrays. So we need to build an equivalent to all the zarr metadata we looked at in the second exercise \"Reading Zarr the Hard Way\". This includes defining:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.zgroup`\n",
    "* `{array}/.zattrs`\n",
    "* `{array/.zarray`\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also need to define a zarr array chunk file via kerchunk references for each tile in our raster. We could create an array per overview level in the tiff if we wanted, but to keep things simple we'll just have one array for the full resolution data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the band of the original Sentinel 2 image that we are working with is the `red` band, so we'll use the name `red` for our array name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What array metadata do we need?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look back to the second exercise to see the list of matadata fields that need to be defined per array in `.zarray`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `chunks`\n",
    "  * Should be our tile dimensions in `(row, col)` order.\n",
    "* `compressor`\n",
    "  * We found the TIFF to be compressed using `DEFLATE` which we inflated using `zlib`; turns out that's really all we need to define here is that our compressor is `\"id\": \"zlib\"`. See [the `numcodecs` docs](https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/compression/index.html) for more information about that and other options. Additional codecs can also be registered.\n",
    "* `dtype`\n",
    "  * As discussed above, this is our _target_ datatype.\n",
    "* `fill_value`\n",
    "  * Also known as `nodata` in more typical GDAL parlance.\n",
    "* `filters`\n",
    "  * This one is a bit more involved. If you recall from exercise one we had to do two things to the tile array after decompression: undo the `PREDICTOR=2` cumulative difference calculation, and apply the scale and offset. Zarr's filters can be used to do both of these transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A filter in Zarr is simply a transformation operation that is done prior to compression, and thus must be reversed after decompression. The order matters here: the are applied sequentially before compression and in reverse order after decompression. [`numcodecs` supports several different filters](https://numcodecs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/filter/index.html), and, like compression codecs, additional filters can be registered.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In our case, we know our data was first modified via the scale and offset. We apply this filter first; note that our scale value is actually inverse of what we need to define here. Also note that the data type changes with this filter from the native/target data type of `float32` to `uint16`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Next, we can undo the cumulative difference with the `delta` filter. As this filter is between scaling/offsetting and compression/decompression, the data type both in and out is `unit16`.\n",
    "* `order`\n",
    "  * This is `C`. Several options are available for this but `C` is a good default. See [these numpy docs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.ravel.html) for more information.\n",
    "* `shape`\n",
    "  * The total size of the array, which is our TIFF image size in `(row, col)` order.\n",
    "* `zarr_format`\n",
    "  * We're gonna stick with `2` here to be consistent and not have to learn _another_ format for this workshop.\n",
    " \n",
    "### How do we define the array chunk references?"
