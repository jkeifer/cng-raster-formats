    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will explore how one can read Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) the hard way, i.e., by requesting and parsing byte ranges by hand. We'll query the Earth Search STAC catalog to find an image in COG format, parse the embedded metadata and file structure out of the file, then use that information to read the bytes of an image tile from the file and process them into a usable numpy array. We'll then visualize that array in a slippy map to verify what we did got us the expected result.\n",

Due to the maximum value of such an integer, standard TIFF files have a maximum file size of 4GB (or 2GB for certain archiac implementations that mistakenly used _signed_ integers for offset values). To get around this limitation, the BigTIFF format was developed using 64-bit integer offsets--but this is not a standard TIFF!

    "* the image space coordinates of that point are (0, 0, 0), which effectively allows us to consider the model space coordiantes to be the geographic point represented by the image origin\n",

    "The [GeoTIFF spec docs detailing how to use these values are here](http://geotiff.maptools.org/spec/geotiff2.6.html).

Sometimes neither of these tags are present, such as when the transformation is not affine, which is typically when the `tie_point` tag would have multiple points describing a warp mesh over the image. Consult the docs to fully understand the interactions of these three tags and how to interpret their values outside this simple affine case.\n",

We can use the `pixel_scale` and `tie_point` tag values to construct an affine transform object, which we'll use to perform coordinate transformations between model space (the image CRS) and image space (pixel coordinates). We need to be able to do this to find what pixel in the image contains our POI, so we can find which image tile to read."

    "#### Geo key directory and the params\n",
    "\n",
    "Another set of GeoTIFF-spec tags, `geo_key_directory`, `geo_double_params`, and `geo_ascii_params` represent a collection of geospatial information we need to interpret the data in a spatially-aware way. For example, such important information as the CRS is stored amongst these tags. The [GeoTIFF spec docs also document these tags and their interactions](http://geotiff.maptools.org/spec/geotiff2.4.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, `geo_double_params` and `geo_ascii_params` are actually sets of parameters that can be used to fill in information that cannot be represented directly in the `geo_key_directory` due to data type differences (the latter is a `uint16` tuple whereas the former two are tuples of double precision floats and ASCII-encoded strings, respectively). The `geo_key_directory` is a collection of four-tuples (potentially with some additional trailing values), the first of which is a header that documents the tuples that follow. It has the following 8-byte structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Header = (KeyDirectoryVersion, KeyRevision, MinorRevision, NumberOfKeys)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the important piece here are the number of keys: we need to know how many keys are in the directory to be able to work out the offset to any additional values in the directory structure we might need to fill in directory entries that have multiple `unit16` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the header, each of the keys in the directory have the 8-byte structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "KeyEntry = (KeyID, TIFFTagLocation, Count, Value_Offset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `KeyID` here is just like our TIFF tags: it is an identifier that can be used with an external lookup table to interpret the meaning of the key's value. The `TIFFTagLocation` is used to point to a TIFF tag that contains the value for this key: if the value is directly embedded in the key (in the place of `Value_Offset`) then the location is `0` and this key's value is of type `uint16`. In cases where the value is not directly embedded in the key the location will have the value of the tag code that contains the value. The `Value_Offset` and `Count` can then be used to extract the set of values pertaining to this key from that tag's data. The data type of the key value is given by the source tag's data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a key entry with the values `(1024, 0, 1, 1)` we know that the key ID is `1024`, the location of `0` means the value is embedded in the key entry, and that means our count is necessarily `1` and we can interpret the `Value_Offset` as the key value, in this case `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complex example could be like `(2049, 34737, 7, 22)`: in this case we have a non-zero location, so we have to read the values--in this case seven values per the count value--from a separate tag. The location of `34737` corresponds to the `geo_ascii_params` tag, which not only tells us where to get the values for this key, but also their data type. If we have a value of the `34737` tag of `b'WGS 84 / UTM zone 10N|WGS 84|\\x00'`, then taking 7 bytes from position 22 we end up with `b'WGS 84|'`. The `|` is intended to be converted into a null byte to terminate the extracted string; in Python it is easy enough to read one less byte than the key's count for ASCII-type keys as string termination is handled for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the above explanation to write a general-purpose function to extract the keys into a dict, like we originally did with the IFD tags, and then we can use it to extract our keys. Refer to the [GeoTIFF document \"Geocoding Raster Data\"](http://geotiff.maptools.org/spec/geotiff2.7.html#2.7) for and explanantion of the key IDs and how to understand their meanings. These keys are critical for finding the CRS of the file via the information presented in that documentation."

    "After parsing all IFDs in the file, including reading and unpacking all the tags, we see that the max byte read from the file (`max_ifd_byte`) is merely 4208. Thus we could be pretty sure, even for a an absolutely huge TIFF file, that reading something like the first 1-2 MB of file data would give us the entire set of IFDs. We could use this insight to make our reader more efficient: if we made only one read request to for the first 1-2 MB of the file, we could be pretty certain we could parse the IFD without having to incur the penalty of any further network round trips, at least until we are ready to retrive image data."
